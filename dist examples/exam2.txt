In order to discuss improving academic writing, we’ll begin with a discussion of the purpose of this research project, followed by a discussion of foundational literature emphasizing the development of communicative competence. 

Next we’ll consider several research questions that will operationalize the approach to researching the development of academic writing skills, which will be further addressed in the form of a concept map

After that, we’ll discuss research methods and approaches to measurement as we consider the finer details of this research project.

Finally, we’ll address answers to the research questions in terms of analysis of results associated with this research project, as well as the strengths and limitations of this research project.

South Korean University learners of English, particularly engineering students at the graduate level, need to communicate their innovative research with the global community of scientists, researchers, and firms developing and implementing new technologies. However, clear and precise technical communication can be quite challenging for non-native language users, thereby limiting the quality of their technical communication. Research on the development of communicative competence, has identified three language elements learners acquire on the path toward communicative competence: complexity, accuracy, and fluency (Housen & Kuiken, 2009). Though a university course intended to facilitate the development of complexity, accuracy, and fluency, South Korean university learners of English may be able to develop the quality of their technical communication.
